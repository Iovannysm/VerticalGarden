    <h4>Why Go Vertical?</h4>
    <ol>
      <p>Vertical gardens are great for creating visual interest in any space, whether it be indoors or outdoors. They allow you to create something new and unique that isn’t necessarily found everywhere.Vertical gardens can also have a positive impact on the environment:</p>
      <li>Air purification: many indoor plants are known for their air-purifying qualities. They can help to remove pollutants from the air, that can lead to improved indoor air quality, which can have a positive impact on health.</li>
      <li>Energy efficiency: Vertical gardens can act as natural insulation, helping to regulate indoor temperatures and reducing the need for heating and cooling systems. This can lead to increased energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
      <li>Water conservation: Indoor vertical gardens can be designed to use a closed-loop watering system, which minimizes water waste. This can help to conserve water, which is a valuable resource in many parts of the world.</li>
